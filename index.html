        <h1>KISII MESSIANIC STUDENTS ASSOCIATION</h1>
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <P> We the members of the church of God believe in 40 points of doctrine which have been prepared and cover the principle teachings of the church. These 40 points of believes represent lifetimes and years of the study of scriptures on the path of dedicated men of God who devoted their lives to “rightly dividing the word of truth”. They are and have been the teachings of the church of God for generations, and are in harmony with the doctrines as taught by Christ and the apostles in the early days of the church.
            All these points of believe have been taken directly from the Bible, God’s holy word, which is our only guide and scriptural references are given after each point. Attached in within the constitution are the 40 points of doctrine.
            We adopt enact and give this constitution to ourselves and future kisii University messianic students association. (KSUMSA)
            </P>
